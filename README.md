# Vityarthi-Project-Music-Playlist-Organiser-
The project focuses on applying the robust concepts of python which we have learnt in Vityarthi lessons. As assigned, I have worked on creating a music playlist organiser which takes input from user for playlist creation and then adding/removing songs from the playlist. It can handle multiple playlists.
