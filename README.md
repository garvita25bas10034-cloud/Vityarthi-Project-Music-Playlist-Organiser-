# Vityarthi-Project-Music-Playlist-Organiser-

# Project Overview
The project focuses on applying the robust concepts of python which we have learnt in Vityarthi lessons. As assigned, I have worked on creating a music playlist organiser which takes input from user for playlist creation and then adding/removing songs from the playlist. It can handle multiple playlists.

# Features
Following are the features supported by my program:
-It takes input form the user so it is universally interactive and works according to the wishes of the user.
-In the starting of the program it offers a menu which has 7 options, which are creating a new playlist, viewing existing playlists, deleting old playlists, adding/removing songs and so on.
-It uses the basic concepts of python and majorly I have utilised the dictionary data type to store the data while the program runs.

# Technologies and Tools Used
-Python library: I have used the time module (built in library) which manages the runtime of the program i.e. it is a user experince feature which makes it easy for the user to read the output before the main menu appears again.

-Dictionary: It is the main soul of the program, all the data storing for playlists happen here, it provides an efficient key-value mapping where the unique key is the playlist name (a string), and the value is the list of songs belonging to that playlist. This allows for quick lookup and management of playlists by name.

-List: It is the support system of the program i.e. it stores the values entered for dictionaries. Since it is mutuable that is why we can edit the entries even after enetring it for the first time.

-User Interactive: To make the system user interactive I have used the basic statements like print and input.

-def function: This function allows us to create user defined functions which is the major component of the program. It helps in organising the code.

# Steps to install and run the project
Open the repository link and then dowmload the zip file of the program and then open the zip file in VS code and then the code can be runned and tested.
